# Activities

A really minor tool. 

I've got a few days at home with the kids this week and wanted a random actitivy picker for us. Activities are manually added to the JSON file at the moment although I've started putting in a form on the index page to write to the json file to add activities on the fly.

## To-do

* Take form input from index, parse results and write to activ.json
* Style
* Add a big green refresh button to the page for kiddie-friendly refreshes.
